                <p>
                    For most of us, cars are just machines that have been apart of lifes since we were
                    born. Their history stems from the 19th century. What started as just a cart and
                    wheels have evolved into sophicated machines. Automobiles aren't just artifacts to 
                    transport people and things, they are now used to make bold statements of wealth and
                    power. In this blog we will touch a little bit on their history and also look at a few 
                    key auto-manufacturers in the industry.

                <p>
                        The early history of the automobile can be divided into a number of eras, based on the 
                        prevalent means of propulsion. Later periods were defined by trends in exterior styling, 
                        size, and utility preferences.
                        In 1769 the first steam-powered automobile capable of human transportation was built by 
                        Nicolas-Joseph Cugnot.
                        <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2a/Joseph_Cugnot%27s_1770_Fardier_%C3%A0_Vapeur%2C_Mus%C3%A9e_des_arts_et_m%C3%A9tiers%2C_Paris_2015.jpg/1024px-Joseph_Cugnot%27s_1770_Fardier_%C3%A0_Vapeur%2C_Mus%C3%A9e_des_arts_et_m%C3%A9tiers%2C_Paris_2015.jpg" rel="Cugnot's steam wagon">
                        In 1808, François Isaac de Rivaz designed the first car powered by an internal combustion 
                        engine fueled by hydrogen.
                        In 1870 Siegfried Marcus built the first gasoline powered combustion engine, which he placed 
                        on a pushcart, building four progressively more sophisticated combustion-engine cars over a 
                        10-to-15-year span that influenced later cars.
                        In 1885, Karl Benz developed a petrol or gasoline powered automobile.[2] This is also considered 
                        to be the first "production" vehicle as Benz made several other identical copies. The automobile 
                        was powered by a single cylinder four-stroke engine

                    <img src="https://enthusiastnetwork.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/sites/5/2015/07/1908-Ford-Model-T-side.jpg?impolicy=entryimage" rel="Ford T model" class="tmodel">
                    Henry Ford's Model T was produced for 19 years, from 1908 to 1927, and almost 15 million were made, 
                    with prices falling from $825 to $260 by 1925 as Ford refined the mass-production process. But the 
                    Model T was more than just a car. It put America on wheels and so changed the way Americans worked, 
                    the way they lived, and the way they played. Shopping malls, motels, planned suburbs with affordable housing, 
                    well-paid manufacturing jobs, and an emerging middle class eager to enjoy the perks of prosperity — this was modern, 
                    `   20th-century America, and the Model T helped create it all.
                    <img src="https://enthusiastnetwork.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/sites/5/2015/07/1932-Model-18-side.jpg?impolicy=entryimage" rel="Ford Model 18">
                    Launched in 1932, the Ford Model 18 was the first mass-market car in the world with a V-8 engine, and created a paradigm 
                    for American cars that continues to this day. In the 1930s Ford V-8s were prized for their performance — gangster John 
                    Dillinger wrote to thank Henry Ford for building "as fast and sturdy a car as you did" — and after World War II they formed 
                    the backbone of the nascent hot rod movement, being cheap, plentiful, and easy to modify for extra performance. With '32 Fords 
                    still regarded as the most desirable of all hot rods, this is a car that's remained a pop-culture icon for more than 80 years.

                    "The Jeep, the Dakota airplane, and the landing craft were the three tools that won the war," claimed Dwight D. Eisenhower, 
                    Allied Supreme Commander during World War II. More than 700,000 Jeeps had been built by the war's end, giving Allied troops 
                    overwhelming superiority of movement on the ground. Post-war, the tough, nimble, go-anywhere Jeep enjoyed a second, more peaceful 
                    career as a recreational vehicle, establishing the nexus between capability, style, and functionality that still underpins 21st-century 
                    car buyers' love affair with crossover vehicles. The Jeep is the car that saved democracy. And it was the seminal SUV.

                    <br><br><br>Rock 'n' roll began with a song about a car: Elvis Presley was still driving a gravel truck when 19-year-old Ike Turner walked into a tiny 
                    studio owned by Sam Phillips in Memphis in 1951 and recorded "Rocket 88," a paean to the fastest American sedan you could buy at the time, 
                    the Oldsmobile 88 powered by the 135-hp Rocket V-8 engine. Launched in 1949, the Rocket-powered 88 was America's first muscle car, proving 
                    almost unbeatable in stock car racing through 1951. The record "Rocket 88" was an unexpected hit, and the royalties enabled Phillips to 
                    start Sun Records, the label that gave musicians such as B.B. King, Jerry Lee Lewis, Johnny Cash, and, of course, Elvis their starts.
                    <img src="https://enthusiastnetwork.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/sites/5/2015/07/2016-Chevrolet-Corvette-Z06-Spice-Red-Design-package-front-three-quarter.jpg?impolicy=entryimage" rel="Chevy Corvette" class="corvette">
                    Making its debut in 1953, the Corvette is 10 years older than Porsche's 911, and every bit as iconic. Like the Rolling Stones, 
                    the Corvette has had a patchy track record — the asthmatic 165-hp C3 of the mid-'70s is the equivalent of disco-era Mick and Keef phoning it in. 
                    But when it's been good, the Corvette has been breathtaking. The beautiful Bill Mitchell-designed C2 Sting Rays, particularly the fuel-injected 327s with 
                    four-speed manual transmissions, were arguably better cars than contemporary E-type Jaguars, while today's 650-hp Z06 is a true high-performance sports 
                    car with leading-edge technology and performance equaling that of rivals costing two or three times the price.

                    The first stationary gasoline engine developed by Carl Benz was a one-cylinder two-stroke unit which ran for 
                    the first time on New Year’s Eve 1879. Benz had so much commercial success with this engine that he was able
                    to devote more time to his dream of creating a lightweight car powered by a gasoline engine, in which the 
                    chassis and engine formed a single unit.

                     The Beetle was commissioned in the 1930s by Adolf Hitler as the "people's car" (or volks wagen in
                     German). Designed by Ferdinand Porsche, the curvy car was affordable, practical and reliable. 
                     Three decades later, the "Bug" (as it was affectionately known) became a symbol of the 1960s 
                     and the "small is beautiful" ethos.

                    Do not sleep on the Japanese! Japanese makers are leading in every aspect of automobiles, may it be technology, 
                    sales, production. Around six out of ten leading car makers in the world are Japanese makers. Toyota, Nissan, Honda, 
                    Suzuki, Mitsubishi are few popular Japanese car makers. Japanese automakers started from the very beginning to reach 
                    a place where they are. The major automaker, Toyota Motor Corporation started as a division of Toyota Automatic Loom 
                    Works for commercial weaving applications in Koromo. Later on the company was hired by the Japanese government for 
                    manufacturing cost-effective cars for military purposes. For the past three decades, Toyota has manufactured 3 million 
                    units a year in Japan only. However, overseas production has grown to 5 million units annually from 200,000 units in the 1980s

                    Clean, efficient, silent, relentless… the cars of the future will all be powered by electric motors. Yet this advanced technology 
                    actually dates back to Victorian times when battery-powered horseless carriages shimmied around the streets of London and Paris. 
                    The first land speed record was set in by Count de Chasseloup-Laubat in an electrically driven Jeantaud – he briefly touched 39mph.
                    Since then, Electric cars have evolved so much! Check out our list of a mini, small size and the Tesla Roadster! What a beast...
